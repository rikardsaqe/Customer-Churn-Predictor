# Customer-Churn-Predictor

I built an Artificial Neural Network architecture to predict customer churn (whether or not a customer will leave) for 
a fictitious bank across a 6 month time period with an ~81% accuracy.

# Getting Started

- Download and run built_ann.py 
- Ensure Churn_Modelling.csv is in the same folder

# Built With

- The [Spyder IDE](https://www.spyder-ide.org/)
- **Data Processing:** [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), and [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) 
- **Model Training/Iterating:** [Keras](https://keras.io/) and [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html)

# Next Steps For Improvement
- Apply the model to different datasets/usecases 
- Expirment with the architecture (number of nodes and layers)
