# Customer-Churn-Predictor

Built an Artificial Neural Network architecture to predict customer churn (whether or not a customer will leave) for 
a fictitious bank across a 6 month time period with an ~81% accuracy.

Developed in the Spyder IDE using NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Keras.

Running built_ann.py and importing the Churn_Modelling.csv dataset should enable you to be able to plug and play with it 
as well.

Steps to further improve on this model and skillset would be to apply it to different datasets/usecases and expirment with 
the architecture (number of nodes and layers).

Built as part of the Deep Learning A-Z Udemy course: https://www.udemy.com/course/deeplearning/
